You can use this code for:

1. State-of-the-art face clustering in linear complexity.
2. High efficiency generic clustering.
3. Plugging the pair-to-cluster module into your clustering algorithm.

## Dependency

* Please use python3, as we cannot guarantee its compatibility with python2.
* The version of PyTorch we use is 0.3.1.
* Other depencencies:

    ```sh
    pip install nmslib
    ```

## Usage
0. Clone the repo.

    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:XiaohangZhan/cdp.git
    cd cdp
    ```

### Using ready-made data for face clustering

1. Download the data from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Fs8oN1JiGJRC93TkfDV-PaCeXQz-Htea) or [Baidu Yun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/15A6SL7JFIQaozUIEhtekxQ) with passwd `u8vz` , to the repo root, and uncompress it.

    ```sh
    tar -xf data.tar.gz
    ```

2. Make sure the structure looks like the following:

    ```sh
    cdp/data/
    cdp/data/labeled/emore_l200k/
    cdp/data/unlabeled/emore_u200k/
    # ... other directories and files ...
    ```

3. Run CDP

    * Single model case:

        ```sh
        python -u main.py --config experiments/emore_u200k_single/config.yaml
        ```

    * Multi-model voting case (committee size: 4):

        ```sh
        python -u main.py --config experiments/emore_u200k_cmt4/config.yaml
        ```

    * Multi-model mediator case (committee size: 4):

        ```sh
        # edit `experiments/emore_u200k_cmt4/config.yaml` as following:
        # strategy: mediator
        python -u main.py --config experiments/emore_u200k_cmt4/config.yaml
        ```

4. Collect the results

    Take `Multi-model mediator case` for example, the results are stored in `experiments/emore_u200k_cmt4/output/k15_mediator_111_th0.9915/sz600_step0.05/meta.txt`. The order is the same as that in `data/unlabeled/emore_u200k/list.txt`. The samples labeled as `-1` are discarded by CDP. You may assign them with new unique labels if you must use them.

### Using your own data

1. Create your data directory, e.g. `mydata`

    ```sh
    mkdir data/unlabeled/mydata
    ```

2. Prepare your data list as `list.txt` and copy it to the directory. If the data is not along with a list file, just make a dummy one, and make sure the length of the list is equal to the number of examples.

3. (optional) If you want to evaluate the performance on your data, prepare the meta file as `meta.txt` and copy it to the directory.

4. Prepare your feature files. Extract face features corresponding to the `list.txt` with your trained face recognition models, and save it as binary files via `feature.tofile("xxx.bin")` in numpy. The features should satisfy `Cosine Similarity` condition. Finally link/copy them to `data/unlabeled/mydata/features/`. We recommand renaming the feature files using model names, e.g., `resnet18.bin`. CDP works for single model case, but we recommend you to use multiple models (i.e., preparing multiple feature files extracted from different models) with `mediator` for better results.

5. The structure should look like:

    ```sh
    cdp/data/unlabeled/mydata/
    cdp/data/unlabeled/mydata/list.txt
    cdp/data/unlabeled/mydata/meta.txt (optional)
    cdp/data/unlabeled/mydata/features/
    cdp/data/unlabeled/mydata/features/*.bin
    ```

    (You do not need to prepare knn files.)

6. Prepare the config file. Please refer to the examples in `experiments/`

    ```sh
    mkdir experiments/myexp
    cp experiments/emore_u200k_cmt4/config.yaml experiments/myexp/
    # edit experiments/myexp/config.yaml to fit your case.
    # you may need to change `base`, `committee`, `data_name`, etc.
    ```
7. If you want to use `mediator` mode, please also prepare the training set, i.e., the features extracted using the same face recognition model as step 4, as well as the meta file containing labels. Organize them in `data/labeled/mydata/` similarly to `data/labeled/emore_l200k/`.

8. Tips for paramters adjusting
    * Modify `threshold` to obtain roughly balanced `precision` and `recall` to achieve higher `fscore`.
    * Higher threshold results in higher precision and lower recall.
    * Larger `max_sz` results in lower precision and higher recall.

### Using single model API for generic clustering

* The example is equivalent to using `experiments/emore_u200k_single/config.yaml`. However, it is easier to use if you prefer single model version of CDP. With this API, you can perform generic clustering on your own data with plenty of metrics to choose.

    ```sh
    # an example
    python -u test_api.py
    ```

### Using isoloated pair-to-cluster module

* This function converts pairs into clusters with extremely high efficiency.

    ```python
    # pairs: numpy array (N,2) containing indices of pairs, N: number of pairs
    # scores: numpy array (N,) containing edge score of each pair
    # max_sz: maximal size of a cluster
    # step: the step to adjust threshold, default: 0.05
    from source import graph
    import numpy as np
    num = len(np.unique(pairs.flatten()))
    components = graph.graph_propagation(pairs, scores, max_sz, step)
    cluster = [[n.name for n in c] for c in components]
    assert sum([len(c) for c in cluster]) == num, "Fatal error: some samples missing, please report to the author: xiaohangzhan@outlook.com"
    ```

## Run Baselines

* We also implement several baseline clustering methods including: KMeans, MiniBatch-KMeans, Spectral, Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC), FastHAC, DBSCAN, HDBSCAN, KNN DBSCAN, Approximate Rank-Order.

    ```sh
    sh run_baselines.sh # results stored in `baseline_output/`
    ```

    Note: Methods marked * are reported with their theoretical upper bound results, since they need number of clusters as input. We use the values from the ground truth to obtain the results. For each method, we adjust the parameters to achieve the best performance.

    Note:

    * For mediator, `110` means using `relationship` and `affinity`; `111` means using `relationship`, `affinity` and `structure`.

    * The results may not be exactly reproduced, because there is randomness in knn search by NMSLIB.

    * Experiments are performed on a server with 48 CPU cores, 8 TITAN XP, 252G memory.
