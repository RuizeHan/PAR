[2023.04] Explaination about the group activity labels.

The vector length of social group activity label is 32. This is because when the model is dealing with social activity, a group with one person (i.e. a person who does not belong to any social group) is also considered. In this case, the group activity is assigned with the individual action label (27 categories). 
In our later study, we may update this annotation.
